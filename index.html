          <p>Hi, reader in the U.S., it seems you use Wikipedia a lot; that's great! 
            It's awkward to ask, but this Friday we need your help. Our 2019 fundraiser 
            will be over very soon. We depend on our exceptional readers to donate; 
            fewer than 2% give. If Wikipedia gives you $2.75 worth of knowledge, the 
            cost of your Friday coffee, take a minute to secure its future with a 
            gift to the Wikimedia Endowment. Thank you.</p>
