                              <h2> Some Interesting story </h2>
                              <p> One thing that’s great about short stories is how quickly they can ruin 
                                your life. Maybe you start reading one over your lunch break and, if it’s 
                                the right one, before that peanut butter cup you brought for dessert even 
                                has a chance to finish its melting shape-shift into some kind of sugary 
                                cement, the whole world has been destroyed around you and then rebuilt, 
                                and nothing is quite the same again. 
    
                                This happens whether you like it or not. Great stories practice this 
                                violent beauty on you in a variety of ways: some by making an absurd world 
                                familiar (or vice versa), some with a slow burn, some with a voice that 
                                colonizes your thoughts. Some do it quietly, almost without you even 
                                noticing, and some do it with high wire acts of imagination or intellect 
                                that make you into a breathless witness. 
    
                                The trick, then, is finding the right story, one that is capable of such a 
                                thing. This is no easy task. Tastes differ, of course, and it can be confusing 
                                to spot the small boat of a great story on the wide sea of fiction. What any 
                                reader can offer you in terms of guidance is actually the same thing that any 
                                good writer can offer you with the story itself: a way of saying, This is 
                                what moved me and made me feel strange and alive in some way; here, why 
                                don’t you give it a try?
